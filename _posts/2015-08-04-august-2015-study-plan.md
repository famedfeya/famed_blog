<!--more-->The <strong>Red</strong> days indicates days when I did not study at all. Let’s face it, we are all human and we have a tendency of being lazy <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span>. <strong>Yellow</strong> is for days when I did actually study but did not meet the planned number of hours. Finally,<strong>Green</strong> symbolizes the days when I actually studied the planned number of hours. <strong>Dark green</strong> (which is no where right now), will indicate the days when I did more than was expected of me.
