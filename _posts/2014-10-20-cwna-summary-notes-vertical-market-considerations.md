A vertical market is a particular industry or group of businesses in which similar products or services are developed and marketed.

<h2>Outdoor Surveys</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Weather proof APs (eg ruggedized) may need to be deployed.</li>
    <li>Site Survey kits with Mesh APs may be needed.</li>
    <li>Consider the weather conditions. Most appliances will need to be protected from weather elements by using NEMA rated enslosure units (NEMA - National Electrical Manufacturers Association)</li>
    <li>Safety - hire professional installers.</li>
    <li>Consider RF considerations set by the local government.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aesthetics</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Very important in the retail industry and the hospitality industry.</li>
    <li>Some APs can be camouflaged to resemble smoke detectors.</li>
    <li>Indoor enclosures can also be used to conceal APs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Government</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Main concern is security.</li>
    <li>Obtaining the proper security credentials will be a requirement before conducting the government survey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Obtaining the proper security credentials will be a requirement before conducting the survey.</li>
    <li>Secure APs to prevent theft.</li>
    <li>user density should be accounted for during capacity and coverage planning</li>
    <li>bridging solutions will be needed between buildings across the campus</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Main concern is sources of interference from the biomedical
equipment that exists on site</li>
    <li>A thorough spectrum analysis survey is extremely important. Do several sweeps of the area.</li>
    <li>The applications used in the medical environment should all be considered during the interview and the survey (Handheld PDAs, Medical carts, VoIP phones)</li>
    <li>Obtaining the proper security credentials will be a requirement before conducting the survey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hotspots</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Limit RF coverage area by using low power settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Retail</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Intereference and multipath is a concern.</li>
    <li>Heavy user density should be considered</li>
    <li>Coverage is usually a greater concern than capacity because wireless data collection devices require very little bandwidth.</li>
    <li>May mainly use the 2.4 band.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Warehouses</h2>

<ul>
    <li>currently all handheld devices use 2.4 GHz radios</li>
    <li>Coverage, not capacity, is the main objective</li>
    <li>Use directional antennas mostly</li>
    <li>Reflections and multipath is a concern.</li>
    <li>High ceilings may cause coverage issues.</li>
    <li>Seamless roaming is mandatory because the handheld devices will be mobile</li>
    <li>Survey should be taken during peak times ans compared with the results obtained during low peak. RF power levels may need to be adjusted according to stock.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manufacturing</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Multipath is a concern</li>
    <li>Heavy machinery and robotics may present safety concerns to the surveyor</li>
    <li>Ruggedized APs may need to be installed</li>
    <li>A meeting with the plant’s union representative is necessary to make sure that no union policies will be violated by the site surveyor team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multitenant Buildings</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Biggest issue is presence of other WLAN equipment used by nearby businesses</li>
    <li>strong consideration should be given to deploying an 802.11a WLAN using the 5 GHz UNII indoor and middle bands</li>
</ul>
