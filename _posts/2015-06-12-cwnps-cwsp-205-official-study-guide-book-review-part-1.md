When I think of theÂ CWNP Program, I think of actual Wireless knowledge that Vendor oriented programs have failed to deliver. I have always used CWNP books to complement information that was missing during my past CCNP Wireless exams (2 more to go). It was therefore only logical that I would turn to their CWSP book to help me prepare for the next exam - 642-737 IAUWS.

Luckily, the new CWSP-205 study guide had just been published so I figured I would order it. Got the book yesterday and I have to say, am a tad disappointed. I have not read the book. I simply skimmed through it to see what is included and to be honest, I cannot help but compare it with the previous CWSP book published by Sybex.<!--more-->

It is an official study guide! Where are the sample questions, the flashcards? A lot of information seems to have been cut out too :(. Is Certitrek trying to monetize the CWNP program? To be honest, I will need to go back and order CWSP-204 book from Sybex just to compliment the new CWSP-205 book. This is now becoming a train - get the CWSP-205 to compliment Cisco's 642-737 IAUWS. Then get the CWSP-204 to compliment the gaps in CWSP-205 :(. Why can't we simply update the information and leave everything else intact? I truly hope that I will manage to complete the CWAP,SP,DP and NA exams before Certitrek comes with more shocking renewals.

Once I read the book, I will come back with an actual content review and I hope CWNP will not disappoint :).

The views expressed here are in no way meant to discredit the CWNP program or materials. I still consider it the best, If you want to really understand Wireless and reduce the knowledge gap that vendor oriented certifications have. Am just a little disappointed that the questions are out and some content is missing too. I wish Sybex would continue to publish their books because Sybex holds nothing back - the CD, the flashcards, the questions - you want it, take it :).

Anyway, off to read the book. Will come back for an actual content review later.

Adios!
