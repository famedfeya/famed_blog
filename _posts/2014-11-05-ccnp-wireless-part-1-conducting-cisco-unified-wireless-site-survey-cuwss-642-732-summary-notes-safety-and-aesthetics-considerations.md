<h2>Safety Considerations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Ladder and Aerial Lift Safety - horizontal distance from the top support to the footoftheladder is about one-fourth of the working lengthoftheladder. Do not  exceed the lift maximum load, taking into account the worker, the materials, and the tools.
<ul>
    <li>Self-supporting (foldout) and portable ladders that are not self-supporting (leaning) must be able to support at least four times the maximum intended load.</li>
    <li>The angle of the ladder should be such that the top of the ladder covers a fourth of the working length of the ladder</li>
    <li>If you need access to the ceiling for access point placement do
not use a forklift; use an aerial lift with a safety harness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Site-Specific Safety - It might require safety clothing and training so one needs to prepare before hand.</li>
    <li>FCC Safety Rules - OSHA 1910.97 has listed RF as a hazardous environment so safety should be taken when dealing with wireless equipment.</li>
    <li>Enterprise-Specific Safety - there may be specific safety requirements for some businesses.</li>
    <li>AP-Related Safety - Read the Cisco Installation Guide for your AP before installation and also follow the grounding procedures.</li>
</ul>
