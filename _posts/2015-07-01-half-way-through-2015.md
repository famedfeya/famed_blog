We are half way through the year but It feels like the year has just begun. The plans remain unaccomplished, the dreams get bigger by the day but reality is a sad little story :). When I think that am a tad wiser, I get slapped back and realize that am actually stupidier than I thought I was initially. But then again, there is still hope. We are only half way through the year. Giving up is definitely not an option. Head held high. Eyes on the price. It’s time for my mid-year revolution.
