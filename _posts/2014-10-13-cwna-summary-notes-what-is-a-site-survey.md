A Site Survey is an in-depth examination and analysis of a WLAN site.

<h2>Purpose of a Site Survey</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Achieve the best possible performance from the WLAN</li>
    <li>Certify that the installation will operate as promised</li>
    <li>Determine the best location for APs</li>
    <li>Develop networks optimized for a variety of applications</li>
    <li>Ensure that the coverage will fulfill the organization’s requirements</li>
    <li>Locate any unauthorized APs on the network</li>
    <li>Map any nearby wireless networks to determine existing radio interference</li>
    <li>Reduce radio interference as much as possible</li>
    <li>Make the wireless network secure</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Perform a Site Survey</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Prior to installing a new WLAN</li>
    <li>Physical changes to a building.</li>
    <li>Changes to an existing wireless network.</li>
    <li>Changes in network needs</li>
    <li>Significant changes in personnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Categories of Site Surveys</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Predeployment Site Surveys</li>
    <li>Postdeployment Site Surveys</li>
    <li>Periodic Site Surveys - health check survey</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting Site Surveys</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Site Surveys</h2>

Manual Site Survey - walking through the site with a laptop or other.

<ul>
    <li>Passive Manual Site Survey - wireless client device is only listening to packets as they are sent and received</li>
    <li>Active manual Site Survey - involves both receiving as well as sending packets to determine the status of the WLAN. it is more informative than the passive survey.</li>
</ul>

Predictive Site Survey - virtual survey of the area that uses modeling techniques to design the wireless network.
