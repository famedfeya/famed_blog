It is day one of the month, hence the best time to plan my study hours. Here is the study plan for July. You can watch my progress here as the days go by.

The <strong>Red</strong> days indicates days when I did not study at all. Let’s face it, we are all human and we have a tendency of being lazy <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span>. <strong>Yellow</strong> is for days when I did actually study but did not meet the planned number of hours. Finally,<strong>Green</strong> symbolizes the days when I actually studied the planned number of hours. <strong>Dark green</strong> (which is no where right now), will indicate the days when I did more than was expected of me.
